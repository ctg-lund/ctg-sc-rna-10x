Pipeline steps:
Cellranger version: cellranger v6.0
* Demultiplexing (cellranger mkfastq): Converts raw basecalls to fastq, and demultiplex samples based on index (https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/6.0/using/mkfastq).
* FastQC: FastQC calculates quality metrics on raw sequencing reads (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). MultiQC summarizes FastQC reports into one document (https://multiqc.info/).
* Align + Counts (cellranger count): Aligns fastq files to reference genome, counts genes for each cell/barcode, perform secondary analysis such as clustering and generates the cloupe files (https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/6.0/using/count).
* Aggregation (cellranger aggr): Automatically creates the input csv pointing to molecule_info.h5 files for each sample to be aggregated and executes aggregation (https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/using/aggregate). This is only run if there is more than one sample pr project.
* Cellranger count metrics (bin/ctg-sc-count-metrics-concat.py): Collects main count metrics (#cells and #reads/cell etc.) from each sample and collect in table
* multiQC: Compile fastQC and cellranger count metrics in multiqc report
* md5sum: md5sum of all generated files

Output:
* ctg-PROJ_ID-output
   * qc: Quality control output.
       * cellranger metrics: Main metrics summarising the count / cell output
       * fastqc output (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/)
       * multiqc output: Summarizing FastQC output and demultiplexing (https://multiqc.info/)
   * fastq: Contains raw fastq files from cellranger mkfastq.
   * count-cr: Cellranger count output. Here you find gene/cell count matrices, secondary analysis output, and more. See (https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/6.0/using/count) for more information on the output files.
   * summaries:
       * web-summary files which provide an overview of essential metrics from the 10x run.
       * cloupe files which can be used to explore the data interactively in the Loupe browser (https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/visualization/latest/what-is-loupe-cell-browser)
   * aggregate:
       * Output from cellranger aggregation. This is only run if there is more than one sample pr project.
   * ctg-md5.PROJ_ID.txt: text file with md5sum recursively from output dir root
